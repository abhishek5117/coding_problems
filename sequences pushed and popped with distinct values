Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false


def pushed_popped(pushed,popped):
	stack=[]
	popped.reverse()  # [1,2, 3,5,4]
	for  x in pushed :  # n
		stack.append(x)
		while stack and stack[-1] == popped[-1]: 
			stack.pop()
			popped.pop()
	return len(stack)==0
 
time=O(2*n)
space=O(n)
